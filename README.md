# improve

`improve` is a verifier for a small language called `imp`.
An example `imp` file is available in this repo, under `example.imp`.

## Usage

```
improve [-c|-h] file.imp
```

The theorem prover has 3 modes:
- `improve -c file.imp` will generate a `.png` of the control flow graph of
  `file.imp`.
- `improve -h file.imp` will print the horn clauses generated by doing a DFS
  of the control flow graph, taking assignments into account.
- `improve file.imp` will use `z3` to evaluate the horn clauses generated by
  `improve -h`, and will tell you if the program is `correct` or `incorrect`.

## Building

`improve` is written in Swift and builds with the Swift package manager.
To build it, simply invoke

```
swift build
```

in the root directory. This will give you a binary at `.build/debug/improve`.
